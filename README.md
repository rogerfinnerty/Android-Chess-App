# Multi-level Chess App
by Group 12

This app is under the *Other* category. The idea for this project is an app that allows a user to play games of chess. It will feature, at the minimum, user vs user capability, pieces obeying laws of chess, proper timing for moves, end game choices for another game, quitting, etc, and a bot player to play against if there is only one player. The proposed other features are, for example, customizable pieces/themes/backgrounds, sound effects for piece movements and takes, predictive move feature, ranking play histories, and different bot player difficulties.
